        <h1>Hi, I'm Nick and I'm a software developer! </h1>
        <h2> You probably already knew that information before you came to this
          site though, so let me tell you some things you might not
          know about me...
        </h2>
        <p>
          Basics first. I'm originally from New York, but went to school at
          Providence college and liked the city so much that I stayed here.
          My absolute favorite movie of all time, without dispute,
          is The Lion King. I will defend my opinion on that to my grave.
          I love math, the Mets and Italian food. I'm struggling to learn to
          play the Ukulele. I love snowboarding, and have played Ultimate
          (Frisbee) obsessively since my Freshman year of college
          way back in 2012.
        </p>

        <p> I picked up coding my junior year of college as part of my
          mathematics major and immediately fell in love. I learned C++
          in school, Python during my senior  year internship, Javascript
          on the side, and I currently develop in PxPlus at
          work. I love a challenge and diving into new problems head first.
          I love learning new tools and trying to approach problems from
          all different angles.

     <h1>Interning at Farsounder</h1>
      <p>Farsounder is a company that makes sonars that generate a 3-D map
        of the ocean floor in front of the ship they&#39;re installed on. 
        I interned there for around a year, and worked in both C++ and Python.
        Although I learned C++ in school, I had never written anything in Python before. 
      </p>
      <p> I learned how to use Python via my first project at the internship. I wrote various 
        scripts that created a hash-based tag support system that functioned as a lookup tool 
        for the large collection of internal data playbacks. Later in the internship, I expanded on
        my Python knowledge to work on a research project regarding the feasibility of using the
        forward-looking sonar for depth approximation. This involved creating visualization tools with
        tkinter and matplotlib to graph the various depths the forward looking sonar recorded, and then,
        using tools like numpy, match them against a straight-down only depth finder for accuracy. 
        The main hurdle with this project was correlating the ship&#39;s path 
        (which provided the straight down measurement) with the array of data taken from in front 
        of the ship.
     </p>
     <p> I also improved my C++ skills there, it being my first experience with C++ out of a classroom. 
         I completed two separate projects with C++ during my internship. First I implemented improvements to the C++
       map based overlay. This involved redesigning the look of how the system displayed the ships recent path.
       It was my first exercise in digging into a deep codebase to find exactly where the logic I needed to change lived.
       Once I tracked that down, changing how the line was drawn was pretty easy. With my newly learned skill of 
       &quot;code spelunking&quot; I moved on to the next portion. Using some trigonometry, I created a feature 
       that tracked where on the map the mouse cursor was, and then calculated the distance the cursor was from 
       the bow of the ship, and at what angle it was. </p><p>For my final project of the internship, I implemented
     a custom shortcut key feature. This project used the <code>RegisterHotKey</code> function in C++ to allow the user 
     to define their own shortcuts in an <code>.ini</code> file, and then used ZeroMQ as a message queue to relay the captured
     hot keys to their corresponding functions in the program (such as zoom, or change modes or themes).
     </p>
     <h1> Work at Computer Associates</h1>
     <p>Computer Associates makes ERP software for millwork companies, lumber yards and door shops. While there I developed
       in a language call <a href='https://pvxplus.com/'>PxPlus</a>. Its a language influenced by Business Basic and boasts
       the benefits of being easy to use to create GUI screens, its own built in database and it works cross platform. Its
       also a language I had never heard of when I started my new job! </p><p>I started working, right out of college,
       in the customer support department, where I was responsible for taking customers error reports, often working 
       directly with the users, in order to track down the origins, and then fix bugs in the software. Sometimes the fixes
       required altering the client&#39;s code base, other times it required reconstructing corrupt data. This was a great
       way to learn both how the industry worked, and learn how to use a language I&#39;d never encountered.
      </p>
      <p> After about a year, I was promoted to become a consultant for the Millwork team. In this role I was responsible 
        for actually developing new software features for clients. I mainly worked directly with clients to customize the
        software package to better fit their daily needs. The biggest project I worked on, however, lived on the web.
      </p>
      <p> One of its the other nice, newer features, PxPlus allowed for a developer to easily convert an existing code base
         to be used on the web. One of our clients wanted to create a web store for their business, and I was assigned to 
        help out on the execution. This involved creating a few new displays to interact with the client&#39;s database, 
        allowing for their customers to make purchases directly, as well as designing the CSS to fit what the client wanted
        the site to look like.

       After completing a few of the freecodecamp projects, I decided to combine
       some of them all into a single page, inspired by
       <a href="https://momentumdash.com/" target="_blank"> the momentum addon.</a>
       This page combines a weather widget, random quote generator and a wikipedia
       search widget, with a random background image. You can find the codepen

       This is my rendition of a
       <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Fibonacci-Clock/"
          target="_blank"> Fibonacci Clock. </a>
       Its a cool way to tell time, based on the Fibonacci sequence.
       small squares are worth 1 each. Then, the values of the squares
       increase based on size (2,3,5). To tell time you add up the squares.
       If a square is blue, it counts towards the hours. If it is green, it counts
       towards minutes. A red square counts for both hours and minutes. To figure
       out the time, sum the hours and minutes. Minutes need to be multiplied by
       5 after they're summed (so it is only accurate within 5 minutes).
       The pictured screenshot represents 4:30. You can find that project
